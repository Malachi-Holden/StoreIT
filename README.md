# StoreIT

Have you dreamed of a home or business where tools and toys and books don't get lost?

StoreIT does not solve this problem.

However it does make it way easier to keep things from getting lost!

Any items that you want stored in a consistent location can be tracked by StoreIT on your Android tablet or phone. Easily create embedded locations and note down where an item is stored. Clean up is easy: just open the app and search for an item's location to know where it goes. Looking for something? Just search in the app.

No need to remember where items are stored. Every item is placed in a location, which itself is embedded in a location. All locations are embedded at some depth within the root location, which could be your home, business, or other space.

Example: Where is the pasta pot?

- Search for "pasta pot" in the app
- View chain of locations
- Home > Kitchen > left cupboard > bottom shelf

You immediately have a direct route to the item.

You can set up your space with as much detail as you want. Each room in your house could be a location -- or each section of each drawer of each cabinet. You can record the locations of whatever items you want in the house. If you want, you could catalogue every item you own, down to the last pen. Or if you want the flexibility you could record just the expensive or important things, or just the things that are shared by multiple people. You're the boss!
